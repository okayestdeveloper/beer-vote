# Beer-Vote

I had a need for fans and consumers of my homebrew to give me feedback on what they'd like me to brew next along with rating the output. I've seen websites like this before, but I was also bored and looking for a new project, so this was born.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First you'll need to clone the repository and install dependencies.

```
yarn install
```

### Running locally

In the project root, running `yarn start` will start a mock server, then compile the app and open your default browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Tests

All testing is through [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). At the root of the project, simply run

```
$ yarn test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Deploying

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
